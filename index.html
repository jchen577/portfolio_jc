          In this game, I worked on the physics interactions. This entails
          resizing the player character and adjusting their mass to change how
          they push objects around. I also worked on making sure that objects
          pushed would react appropriately, and that fallin on the floor would
          destroy them and award the player points <br /><br />

          A representation of how children see the world of Dungeons and
          Dragons! Roll dice, move your piece, collect resources, play cards,
          all in an attempt to gather reputation. Beat your rival to the
          reputation goal and win!

        <p>
          I worked on nearly all parts of this game. My biggest focus was on the
          dice, ensuring they randomly rolled, were able to be selected, and
          creating backend support for other developers to use their
          information. My 2nd biggest contribution is working on the game
          manager, making sure that players couldn't perform actions outside of
          the rules, and combining other mechanics made by the other developers.
