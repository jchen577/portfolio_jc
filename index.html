        <p>
          In this game, I worked on the physics interactions. This entails
          resizing the player character and adjusting their mass to change how
          they push objects around. I also worked on making sure that objects
          pushed would react appropriately, and that fallin on the floor would
          destroy them and award the player points <br /><br />

          reputation goal and win!
        </h3>
        <p>
          I worked on nearly all parts of this game. My biggest focus was on the
          dice, ensuring they randomly rolled, were able to be selected, and
          creating backend support for other developers to use their
          information. My 2nd biggest contribution is working on the game
          manager, making sure that players couldn't perform actions outside of
          the rules, and combining other mechanics made by the other developers.

        <h3>
          A standard RPG where you can fight enemies, get stronger, and acquires
          riches!
        </h3>
        <p>
          This game is coded in Phaser, and was a self-practice project where I
          would take the concepts I learned in class and implement them. Some
          key features are the self-made inventory system and a WIP A*
          pathfinding algorithm. The game has a lot of mechanics/features of a
          typical RPG such as experience, coins, shop NPCs, and level-locked
          areas. In the future I plan to add more content in the forms of items,
          enemies, and map expansions. <br /><br />

        <h3>A small farming game</h3>
        <p>
          A calm game where you can plant sprouts that grow when certain
          conditions are met. This project taught me the process of creating
          player save files by parsing to json, and reading those files to
          create game states. It also taught me how to localize games by having
          separate language files for words used. <br /><br />

        <p>
          A platforming game about viruses trying to invade the earth. Use
          Klungoâ€™s laser gun to stop any nasty enemies that try to get close,
          and make sure Klungo delivers the planet to safety. This game looks
          seemingly simple and easy, but the constant attacks and reviving from
          the viruses are sure to leave even the most patient of players
          maddened.<br /><br />
